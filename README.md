Objective of Conducting This Exploration
The primary objective of this exploration is to leverage the rich and multifaceted dataset of 2,392 high school students to uncover deep insights into the factors influencing academic performance. By systematically analyzing the diverse variables captured in the dataset — including demographic information, study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and academic outcomes — we aim to achieve the following goals:

Identify Key Drivers of Academic Success: Determine the critical factors that most significantly impact students’ grades and overall academic performance. This includes examining the relationship between study habits, parental engagement, and extracurricular involvement with academic achievement.
Inform Educational Strategies: Provide actionable insights that can inform the development of more effective educational practices and policies. By understanding which factors contribute most to student success, educators and policymakers can design interventions that are better aligned with students’ needs.
